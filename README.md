# M226b_VehicleRental
This project will demonstrate a simolator of an vehicle rental. This program uses inheritance and does not include interfaces and abstract classes, since inheritance covers all the necessary things in this project. To compensate for this I have looked into enum and tried to implement it. The planning, the various diagrams and the test cases are contained in a separate word document. This can be found under documents.
